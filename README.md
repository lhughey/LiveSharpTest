# LiveSharpTest
Testing app for LiveSharp

**How to test**

This project is the default XF project created from Visual Studio 2019. The ItemsViewModel.ExecuteLoadItemsCommand() method has been modified to set the text of the item object before added to the Items collection. Commont and uncomment the line that sets the text of the item. The Text property of the items is not reflected without restarting the app.
